## File of directory?

When I was making diretories and listing files to category things.  
Then I thought.

```yml
lang
    samples
    specification
general
```
Look at the above nodes, huh. What is these? 

Is specification a directories? Or is it a file.
I was thiking making it a file at first.
but what if it tends out to be more complex in its content, and i need 
to split into more seperate files for managing them.
This shows the drawback of the traditional view.
And thus, it's showing off the importance of creating a more universally 
and minimal overhead node system. 
node relation and hierarchy is anywhere. Even in a single file.
I don't want to bother to seperate them when the file end up growing 
into a monster. That would be annoying.  
I just want write it out without considering the operating system level designing --
if the os must have to distinguish directory or file.
I just need a node to carry infomations.  
A directoy carries infomations, files carries informations, so why
we distinguished them in the past? 
We need a different strategy for now.
