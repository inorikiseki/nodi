### Construct the semantic  web.

we need to construct a semantic web.

Initially, the word level. Then here cames to the concept 'Dictionary'.

What exactly does this mean? Here I should make a note for recording the idea, for which it's important.

Semantic web and dictionary. I need to bring it to the world.

based on the statistics from the web and dictionay, the compiler is able to eventually know the single words 
meaning.

add_x to_y
print_x with_y
double_x by_y
sub x to y
get x from y
remove x from y

we need do servel levels of analysises.
we could not only translate a phrase as a whole. but look into the it to the single word.

and these have a _Symbol attached is more likely to be a verb of something that needs objectives.

based on the analysis of 'to' we could came up to that it's more like a preposition.

we could do the analysis for the single word, set up the link graph and analyse the meanings of them.

And the key idea is show that again, dont bound the rules ahead. Just analyse on the given facts.

to set up web, which means that we can do precise analysis based 'path'(symbol@root/module/...),
and so precise interpretion for treating the phrase we defined as a whole. But, we also could do other
tricks in another demension, to analyse it in a word level, and single level.


we may combine to compile with the assitance with unprecise defined way. with the help of AI.

compile with precise definition and ai interpertation.
if there is not a precise definition for a node, we can then interpret it with ai interpretation.
of course, in the natrual mode. you may not wish to allow it in effective mode.

(
    Nodic Natrual - Natic
    Nodic Effective - Neffic
)

for example.
add_x to_y
    x, y'mut : number
    => 
        y = x + y
sub_x with_y
    => 'ai

so the compiler will generate the code we wish to have.
yes, it's the debut of the intermediate form of nodic.
in the intermediate form of nodic you can see, what the compiler thinks the 
node should do.

We should construct the dictionary as we do it or similarly we do for a natrual language.

we also need to set up a global(universally like internet) context manage system with version control.
which is the analysis based on all the code or the selected code analysis.
when selecting the desired version control, people can write code more natrually,
without doing much manaually specify the node path.
